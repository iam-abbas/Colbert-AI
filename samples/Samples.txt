WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE FREE FROM THESE THREATS. AND THE PRESIDENT IS PUSHING FOR A $300 MILLION INVESTMENT. AND HE'S TAKING A VERY FEMINIST LINE. HE THINKS WE NEED TO DEFEND OUR RIGHTS. AND WE NEED TO DEFEND THEM, BECAUSE IF WE DON'T, WE'LL BE IN FOR A LOT OF NICE FEELINGS FROM PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE THE WAY WE DO IT. AND WE DON'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY. WE CAN BE THE WAY WE WANT TO BE, OR WE CAN

( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) ( PIANO RIFF ) WELL, IT'S NOT JUST THE REPORT'S FUD. IT'S ITS FURTHER FUDS. THE PRESIDENT IS CALLING THE MUELLER REPORT "THE FAKE NEWS," AND HE'S GOING TO CALL IT THAT ALL THE TIME. AND HE'S GIVING IT A LOT OF PRESSURE. THE PRESSURE IS GOING TO BE ON IT BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN WARNED FOR YEARS THAT MUELLER WAS ACTUALLY A RUSSIAN SPY. ( LAUGHTER ) AND NOW, THE PRESSURE IS BEING BEHIND THE PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE PRESSURE OF THE PUBLIC'S CONCERN THAT THE MUELLER REPORT IS FAKE. ( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND IT'S BEEN HOPING FOR A WHOOFING CONVERSATION ABOUT THE MUELLER REPORT. BUT, OF

( LAUGHTER ) ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) NOW, TRUMP HAS BEEN HOLDING OUT ON THIS PREDICTION FOR A WHILE, BUT NOW THAT THE LAW IS IN, AND TRUMP HAS TOLD THE PRESS THAT HE WILL BE ACTING ON IT, THE PRESS HAS A HANDLE FOR IT.

( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND HE'S NOT THE ONLY PERSON TO BE DEPORTED. IN 1977, BLACK PEOPLE IN NORWAY WERE DEPORTED FOR THEIR NATIONALITIES. IN 1990, IN FOUR YEARS, NORWAY DEPORTED MORE PEOPLE THAN ALL OF THE OTHER G7 COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD! ( LAUGHTER ) SO IT'S NOT JUST BLACK PEOPLE IN NORWAY. IT'S ALL OVER NORWAY. IN 1990, THE NORWAY DEPARTMENT DEPORTED ONLY ONE BLACK PERSON. IN 2001, IT WASN'T JUST ONE PERSON. THERE WAS A BLACK MAN DEPORTED IN THE MORNING. ( AUDIENCE REACTS ) THAT'S A BIG DEAL.<|endoftext|>

THIS TIME, IT'S ABOUT THE NAME OF THE DEAL. WE'VE LEARNED SOMETHING, BECAUSE THE WHITE HOUSE JUST ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL BE CALLED "THE WALL." AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ANY OF THE OTHER TERMS WE'VE HEARD ABOUT. THE WHITE HOUSE IS GOING TO CALL IT, "THE WALL."

HE'S TWEETING IT OUT TO SHOW THAT HE'S NOT AS KIND OF AN ASSHOLE AS SOME OF THE MEDIA ARE TALKING ABOUT HIM BEING. ( LAUGHTER )  HE'S TALKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE HE'S READ THE FIRING COMMENT OF SPECIAL COUNSEL AND MAN WHO'S INVOLVING THE RUSSIA LINK, JAMES COMEY, WHICH COMMENTS, "I HAVE READ THE COMMENT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE F.B.I. AND I AGREE WITH HIS COMMENT, THERE IS NO COLLUSION BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND RUSSIA." ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S A GOOD COMMENT. THAT'S A GOOD COMMENT.

AND IT'S REALLY BEEN A NATIONAL EMERGENCY BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW, THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN HOLDING OUT ON TRUMP FOR YEARS, BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT HE WOULD BE GOOD AT CHOPPING UP MILITARY TRAGEDY. BUT HE'S STILL NOT THERE. AND THIS MORNING HE WAS IN A ROOM WITH HIS FAMILY. ( LAUGHTER ) HE WAS EXCITED TO BE PART OF THE DAY, BUT THEN THE PRESIDENT

AND HE'S BEEN THROUGH A LIFETIME OF THIS BECAUSE, YESTERDAY, HE HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE WITH THE EDITORS OF THE NEW YORK TIMES, AND HE SPEAKED ABOUT HIS VIEW OF THE NEWS. HE THREATENED TO HACK THE NEWS MEDIA. I THINK IT'S HARMFUL TO BE A HUMAN BEING. IT HURTS THE HUMAN BEING.

WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE "DELAY-OUT" RULE, WHERE PEOPLE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT HOW TO GET TRUMP OUT OF THE WAY. AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS TO MAKE HIM STOP BEING PRESIDENT. AND THAT'S WHAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE DOING. IN THE SENATE, FORMER REPUBLICAN AND MAN WHO HAS BEEN CALLING TRUMP A "LONE RAPIST," JOHN KERRY, IS RUNNING TO REPLACE DON ROSE. AND HE HAS A GREAT PLAN B. KERRY SAYS TRUMP HAS BEEN "SUBVERTING HIS OWN POSITION." ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S TRUE. TRUMP IS A LONE RAPIST, AND KERRY SAYS HE'LL BE "HANDING OFF HIS CAMPAIGN TO A FEW MORE REPUBLICANS."

SAMPLE 249: <|endoftext|>START: THE BATTLE OF THE TRUMP-IS-A-SCANDAL CONTINUES. LAST WEEK, THE PRESIDENT HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE IN NEW YORK CITY TO DISCUSS THE STATE OF OUR UNION AND THE STATE OF OUR ECONOMY. HE WAS EXCITED TO BE IN THE MIDTERMS OF HIS STATE OF THE UNION, BUT HE WAS ALSO EXCITED TO TALK ABOUT HIS BORDER WALL, WHICH HE SAYS WILL BE "AS BIG AS THE EIGHT CONGRESSMANS' HEADS." ( LAUGHTER ) THAT'S HUGE. THAT'S A LOT. ( APPLAUSE ) THAT'S HUGE. THAT'S HUGE. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) THAT'S BIG. THAT'S A BIG, BIG DEAL.<|endoftext|> 

SAMPLE 250: <|endoftext|>START: THIS IS A ROUGH WEEK FOR THE PRESIDENT, BUT HE'S STILL HAD THE SUPPORT OF HIS CANDIDATE FOR THE ELECTION, RON PAUL. "I'M PRETTY SURE HE'LL MAKE IT," PAUL SAID TO THE AP. "BUT HE'LL BE HARD TO DO IT. I THINK HE'S GOT A GOOD SHARE OF THE DEMOCRATIC POLLS, AND THE POLLS ARE GOING TO BE SO HARD FOR HIM TO COME OUT ON TOP, THAT I'D HIGHLY SUGGEST HE GOES TO VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP." ( LAUGHTER ) ( APPLAUSE )  THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT.<|endoftext|> 

SAMPLE 251: <|endoftext|>START: THE NEWS HAS BEEN HORRIBLE FOR TRUMP. HE HAS BEEN IN THE MIDDLE OF A LOT OF BAD NEWS. THE LATEST ONE: THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATIONS HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL NOT COME FORWARD WITH A CHARGE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP, WHICH IS A HUGE DEAL FOR THE PRESIDENT. THE BUREAU IS ALSO INVESTIGATING MATT TAIBBI'S ALLEGED MALIGN INTERFERENCE WITH THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT. AND TRUMP IS NOT THE ONLY ONE CONCERNED BY THE INVESTIGATION. THERE ARE CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRATS AS well, INCLUDING SENATOR AND DEMOCRATIC FOUNDER OF THE "LATE SHOW," HILLARY CLINTON. AND NOW, THE NEWS HAS CHANGED. TRUMP IS SAYING HE WILL NOT BE CHARGED, AND THE BUREAU WILL NOT INVESTIGATE HIM. AND THE NEW YORK TIMES JUST SAID THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THAT'S TRUE. HE SAID THAT, YOU KNOW, I HAVE NOTHING TO DO 

SAMPLE 252: <|endoftext|>START: NOW, THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY, REALLY, REALLY MAD AT TRUMP. ( LAUGHTER ) I MEAN, I MEAN, REALLY MAD. AND I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS JUST ME OR IF THIS IS TRUE, BUT I THINK THIS IS TRUE. I THINK THIS IS TRUE. AND THIS IS WHY I'M NOT COMING TO YOUR HOUSE TOMORROW NIGHT. I'M GOING TO KEEP MY HEAD DOWN, WORK ON SOMETHING ELSE, AND BE WITH YOU. ( APPLAUSE )  THAT'S RIGHT, KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN, WORK ON SOMETHING ELSE. ( APPLAUSE )  THAT'S WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE NOT WORKING.<|endoftext|> 

SAMPLE 253: <|endoftext|>START: YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE NEW YORK TIMES IS ALSO RUN BY DONALD TRUMP, AND THEY'VE JUST ANNOUNCED THE NEXT PORTION OF THEIR "NEWSPAPERS" COVERAGE. IT'S CALLED "THE NEW YORK TIMES." AND THEY'VE JUST ANNOUNCED THE COVERAGE WITH THE NAME DONALD TRUMP, AND IT'S CALLED, I BELIEVE IT'S THE NAME OF A SINGLE PERSON, DONALD TRUMP. AND I BELIEVE IT'S THE NAME OF A SINGLE PERSON, AND IT'S JUST THE NAME OF A SINGLE PERSON. AND IT JUST COMES TO US FROM A SINGLE PERSON, DONALD TRUMP. AND IT JUST COMES TO US FROM A SINGLE PERSON, AND HE JUST CALLED IT, "THE NEW YORK TIMES." IT'S JUST THE NAME OF A SINGLE PERSON. AND IT'S JUST THE NAME OF A SINGLE PERSON. AND IT JUST COMES TO US FROM THE SAME SOURCE, AND IT JUST COMES TO US FROM THE SAME SOURCE. (LAUGHTER)  IT'S JUST 

SAMPLE 254: <|endoftext|>START: THE NEWS IS FRIDAY. THE PRESIDENT'S AIDING A LOT OF THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENTS, INCLUDING THE REPUBLICANS' REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN POLICY. I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THEY'LL ACT UP FOR IT, BUT THEY SHOULD. ( LAUGHTER ) AND THE NEW YORK TIMES JUST RELEASED A FULL-BLACK AND WHITE VERSION OF THE BOOK, AND IT'S CALLED, "THE NEW REPUBLICAN BOOK." ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND THE PRICE IS $49.95. ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ) AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PRICE IS FOR THE ORIGINAL. IT'S LIKE $200. I'M SORRY. IT'S A NEW BOOK. I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S THE SAME AUTHOR. I DON'T KNOW WHO THIS AUTHOR IS. IT JUST SAYS THE SAME THING. ( LAUGHTER ) AND IT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL. IT LOOKS LIKE A BOOK. IT JUST LOOKS LIKE A BOOK.<|endoftext|>

AND NOW WE'RE LEARNING HE'S A BIG FAN OF "DANCING WITH THE STARS." (LAUGHTER) AND THIS WEEKEND, BIDEN WENT TO "THE O'REILLY BROADCAST" TO SHOW OFF HIS BOWL HANDS AND HIS BOWL STYLE. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT WAS A GREAT SHOW. IT WOULD BE A GREAT SHOW IF IT WASN'T FOR THIS. WE'RE LEARNING BIDEN'S BODY ISN'T JUST A LIFETIME GIFT FROM HIS FAMILY. IT'S A REAL PERSON. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) IT'S A REAL PERSON. (LAUGHTER) IT'S A REAL PERSON. (LAUGHTER) IT'S A REAL PERSON. IT WAS A REAL PERSON WHO DID THIS. IT'
